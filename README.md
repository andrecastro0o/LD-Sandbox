# Linked-Data Sandbox 🏖️

*a repo-blog where I will write, play and code ideas related to linked open data and similar topics*


🦕

## Publishing and Writing 

I will start by exploring the possibilities of [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) as a publishing framework. 
It looks spot on for the ways in which I like to write, mixing markdown and python, in the same document. And having git repository as the publicatin base layer. Plus it released under BSD 3-Clause License. 

## Build 

Inside a virtual envirtual enviroment:  `pip install jupyter-book`

Build HTML ouput from source: `sh build.sh`. Output will be inside `build/_build/`
